# Pipeline activation and migration

> **Status: design stage.** This runbook describes tooling that is not in this

Pipeline activation routes the qualified pipeline for new submissions. Retained
legacy records stay readable. The switch assigns each receipt to one
implementation.

The pipeline now has these properties:

- A receipt ownership record selects the legacy executor or the pipeline.
- A retry of a pre-switch receipt returns the original operation.
- It does not start a new pipeline run.
- Unique ledger source keys prevent both paths from awarding the same receipt.
- Tenant routing is an explicit record. Timestamps do not select the bundle.
- Activation and expansion require current drills, readiness, corpus
  evidence, credit reconciliation, index checks, and invalidation checks.
- Rollback selects an earlier qualified bundle for later runs only.
- An unsafe bound policy must be suspended. The run keeps its package.
- First-rollout containment stops new pipeline receipts. Workers and
  packages remain available.
- Legacy writers disable only after their pending owned work completes.
- Destructive schema cleanup is not part of this phase.

## Pipeline receipt routing before activation

`TRACE_COMMONS_PIPELINE_RECEIPTS_TENANT_IDS` lists the tenants whose new
receipts go to the pipeline. It has an effect only when the ingest build
injects a pipeline runtime. The repository binary injects none.

- Unset or empty (the default): every receipt takes the legacy path.
- Tenants listed with a runtime: those tenants' receipts go to the pipeline.
- Tenants listed without a runtime: ingest refuses to start with
  `pipeline_receipts_configured_without_runtime`.

Activation replaces this list with qualified routing.

## Submission quota at switch-over

The pipeline counts only pipeline receipts against the hourly submission
quota. It does not count legacy submission records. In the first hour after a
tenant moves to the pipeline, that tenant can therefore receive up to one
extra hourly quota. This is accepted behavior.

## Rehearse the switch

Set `TRACE_COMMONS_PG_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL test database.
Then run this command:

```bash
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test versioned_pipeline_pg pipeline_activation
```

The tests cover mixed legacy and pipeline records, exact replay of a
pre-switch receipt, unique ledger sources, tenant expansion gates,
rollback, containment, suspension instead of rebinding, and writer
retirement after pending work completes.

The [local pipeline lab](pipeline-lab.md) `qualify` command runs this suite as part of pipeline qualification. Lab corpus and package evidence remains in local files;
these PostgreSQL integration tests remain separate schema and recovery checks.

## Local operator routes

`trace-commons-pipeline-local` adds these routes:

- `POST /v1/pipeline/switched-submissions`
- `GET /v1/admin/pipeline-routing`
- `POST /v1/admin/pipeline-contain`
- `POST /v1/admin/pipeline-retire-legacy-writer`

The existing corpus paths still submit directly to the pipeline executor.
The switched route is the dual-path receipt used during migration.

## Current completion

None of the redesign is in this repository yet. The versioned pipeline
contracts are defined; the runtime, qualification, and activation work
follows in later changes. `SCR-005` stays deferred until the external
valuation protocol exists. New valuation rules use a later bundle through
the same qualification and activation process.
