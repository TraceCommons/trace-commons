//! Pins the invariants of the release path. These files are shell scripts and
//! workflow YAML, so the assertions are deliberately textual: a YAML parser

//! What this file CANNOT prove: that signing, notarization, or a flatpak build
//! actually work. Only a real run against real credentials shows that. See
